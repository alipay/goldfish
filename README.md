Goldfish is an enterprise level Alipay mini program development framework and can also be called the best practice of Alipay mini program development solution.

## Features

- üñáResponse based state management.
- üìêPerfect TypeScript support and ultimate type hint.
- üöÄComposition API ready (refer to [Vue Composition API](https://vue-composition-api-rfc.netlify.com/)).
  - More flexible logic reuse.
  - More powerful type inference.
  - Smaller packaging size.
- üïπEach module can be used independently without framework.

## Why to use

* The introduction of reactivity system makes codes more expressive and saves plenty of state synchronization codes, so the state management is easier.
* In-depth support for TypeScript is added to the original Alipay mini program, improving greatly the development experience and productivity.
* Like the [Vue Composition API](https://vue-composition-api-rfc.netlify.com/), brand-new method is used for the organization of state logic codes. Compare to the traditional Redux-like state manage system, the boilerplate codes are near to nothing, and it is more friendly to TypeScript.
* With the function based coding style (Composition API) and inner supporting of [Tree-Shaking](https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking/), the useless codes will be fully shaken away.
